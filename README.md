# Santander-Product-Recommendation

Personalized recommendations are proven to be a game changer in many sales problems. They not only improve sales but also improve the customer experience. With a more effective recommendation system in place, Business can better meet the individual needs of all customers and ensure their satisfaction.

Santander is a bank based out of the Spain. They serve their customers with a range of financial products. They want to give their customers a personalized recommendation to improve sales and user experience.
The bank wants all the products that the customer is most likely to buy in the coming one month based on the customer's meta data and historical purchases, so that they can recommend the same product.
This data set does not include any real Santander's customer, and thus it is not representative of its customer base.
In the data we are given 1.5 years of customer purchase history from 01/2015 to 05/2016 and we need to predict what the customer would purchase in the next one month.

I have written a blog on this explaining my approach which can be found here
